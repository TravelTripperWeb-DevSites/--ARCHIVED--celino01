From haunted houses to spooktacular parties, we&rsquo;ve narrowed Miami&rsquo;s Halloween events down to the best of the best (with a mix of both adults-only and kid-friendly events). Embrace the season&rsquo;s spooky spirit with these annual Halloween festivities.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">1. Halloween on Lincoln Road</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thousands of costume-clad visitors take over the iconic pedestrian mall for a night of mingling, trick-or-treating, and bar-hopping. Wear your best costume to the family-friendly Halloween night event beginning at 5 p.m.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">2. HalloWYN Block Party</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wynwood&rsquo;s massive Halloween block party returns for an epic night of free activities, a costume contest, and over 20 food trucks at Wynwood Marketplace. <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/hallowyn-2019-wynwood-halloween-block-party-tickets-62675118968\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">HalloWYN</a> will feature a Fire Bar where A-list bartenders will be slinging cocktails and a Dragon&rsquo;s Den with LED activations, fire spinners, and a marketplace with vendors and DJs.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">3.

Wynwood Fear Factory</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">South Florida&rsquo;s biggest Halloween electronic dance music experience is back on October 25 at Mana Wynwood Convention Center. What&rsquo;s been described as a mash-up between Ultra and Halloween Horror Nights, the horror fest will feature live talent from Illenium, Knife Party, Malaa, EDX, and more international top DJs. If you can&rsquo;t make it to Wynwood Fear Factory, Miami&rsquo;s hottest clubs are throwing their own Halloween dance parties.
